### **Session Series: Building LLM Workflows with LangGraph**

**Goal:** Enable students to design and implement their own workflows using LangGraph and an LLM API (Groq).

#### **Updated Outline:**

---

Intro Session

1. **Introduction to LLMs and APIs**
    
    - ~~What are LLMs? (Brief, non-theoretical)~~ (since the content is covered in previous workshop)
    - Calling an LLM via API (Groq)
    - Hands-on: Sending basic prompts and handling responses.
2. **Final Project Brainstorm: Designing a Custom Workflow**
    
	- Students brainstorm and plan their own LangGraph-powered workflow project.

Session 1

1. **LangGraph Basics: Understanding Flow and Nodes**
    
    - What is LangGraph, and why use it?
    - Nodes, edges, and execution flow.
    - Hands-on: Building a simple chatbot with a sequential workflow.
2. **State Management and Multi-Step Workflows**
    
    - Handling user input across multiple interactions.
    - Using memory for better responses.
    - Hands-on: Building a multi-turn assistant.
3. **Optional for Advanced Students: Conditional Edges and Dynamic Flow**
    
    - Dynamic paths based on user input.
    - Integrating external APIs or knowledge bases.
    - Hands-on (optional): Creating an AI assistant that adapts to different users.

    - Managing failed API calls and unexpected input.
    - Adding logging and monitoring.
    - Hands-on: Implementing error-catching mechanisms.
2. **Expanding Workflows: Tool Integration**
    
    - Calling external APIs for enhanced functionality.
    - Using LangGraph with retrieval (e.g., Wikipedia).
    - Hands-on: Creating an LLM-powered research assistant.
3. **Combining Agents for Advanced Interactions**
    
    - Multi-agent interactions with LangGraph.
    - Use cases for parallel processing.

Session 4

1. **Gradio as frontend**
	- write a simple frontend with Gradio for your project
2. **FastAPI as Backend, with a seperate frontend** (demonstrative, optional for hands on)
3. **second stage Presentation**
	- Students design and implement their application based on their own LangGraph-powered workflow.
	- Presentations and feedback.
