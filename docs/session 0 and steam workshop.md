_Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Instruction-Tuned LLMs_

## **Workshop Overview**

### ‚è∞ Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## **1. Introduction to LLMs** (10 Minutes)

### ü§ñ **Base LLMs vs. Instruction-Tuned LLMs**

- **Base LLMs**:  
    Trained on general data, excelling at tasks like predicting the next word based on context. They are less effective for task-specific or instruction-following use cases.
- **Instruction-Tuned LLMs**:  
    Optimized through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), enabling them to respond more accurately to direct instructions.

### üìå Examples:

**Base LLM Example:**

```markdown
Prompt: "Once upon a time, a brave knight embarked on a quest to save..."  
Output:  
"...the princess from a fierce dragon guarding a mysterious treasure."  
```

**Instruction-Tuned LLM Example:**

```markdown
Prompt: "Write a brief story about a brave knight saving a princess, keeping the tone lighthearted and including a talking dragon."  
Output:  
"Once upon a time, a brave knight named Sir Chuckles set out to save Princess Laughter from a mischievous dragon named Giggles. However, Giggles wasn‚Äôt your typical dragon; he loved cracking jokes more than hoarding gold..."  
```

## **2. Key Principles and Tactics** (25 Minutes)

### üîë **Principle 1: Clarity in Prompt**

#### **Tactic 1: Use Delimiters üñãÔ∏è**

- Always specify the delimiters you are using.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Extract the main idea from the text enclosed by triple curly braces:  
{{{Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent systems. These systems can solve problems and make decisions like humans.}}}"  
```

#### **Tactic 2: Ask for Structured Output üìã**

- Provide a clear structure to guide the response.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Introduce a book with the following details:  
- Title  
- Author  
- Genre  
- Brief synopsis  
Provide the output in this structured format:  
- **Title**:  
- **Author**:  
- **Genre**:  
- **Synopsis**:  
"  
```

#### **Tactic 3: Verify Conditions ‚úîÔ∏è**

- Check if the input follows a specific pattern and define actions if not.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"If the text does not contain a properly formatted date (YYYY-MM-DD), respond with 'Invalid date format.' Otherwise, extract the date."  
```

#### **Tactic 4: "Few-shot" Prompting ‚ú®**

- Provide examples to guide the model.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Complete the following sentences based on the pattern:  
1. The sun is bright. ‚Üí The moon is dim.  
2. The sky is blue. ‚Üí The grass is green.  
Complete the sentence:  
3. The ocean is deep. ‚Üí"  
Output:  
3. The ocean is deep. ‚Üí The mountains are high.  

```

#### **Tactic 5: Provide Task Context üéØ**

- Specify the audience, tone, and purpose of the task.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Write an article introducing renewable energy for a high school science club newsletter. Use a conversational and engaging tone suitable for teenagers."  
```

### üß† **Principle 2: Give the Model Time to Think**

#### **Tactic 1: Specify Steps üõ†Ô∏è**

- Provide clear steps to guide the model.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Guide me through the process of writing a poem step-by-step.  
- The theme is 'nostalgia for childhood.'  
- Help me choose emotions and symbols to express the theme.  
- Provide an initial draft and a method for revising it."  

```

#### **Tactic 2: Encourage Independent Thinking ü§î**

- Prompt the model to evaluate possibilities before answering.
- Example:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Think about the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars before answering: 'Should we invest more in electric vehicles?'"  
```

## **3. Iterative Prompt Engineering Cycle** (10 Minutes)

### üìú **Example: Summarization**

Start with:

```markdown
Prompt: "Summarize this article: [Insert article text]."  
```

Improve iteratively:

```markdown
Prompt: "Summarize the following article in under 100 words. Focus on key arguments: [Insert article text]."  
```

---

## **4. Applications: Summarization and Extraction** (10 Minutes)

### üîÑ **Extract vs. Summarize**

- When summarizing, the keyword "extract" can sometimes yield more concise results.

#### **Example**:

```markdown
Prompt:  
"Extract the three main points from this passage: [Insert text]."  
```

## **5. Personal Use Case: Empowering Learning with GPT** (5 Minutes)

### üí° **Examples with Context**

1. **Brainstorming**  
    **Context**: Planning a community coding workshop for teenagers.
    
```markdown
Prompt:  
"Suggest five creative and interactive ways to teach Python basics to high school students at a weekend workshop."  
```
    
2. **Understanding Complex Concepts**  
    **Context**: Learning about challenging topics in physics.
    
```markdown
Prompt:  
"Explain the theory of relativity to a high school student using a relatable analogy and simple terms."  
```
    
3. **Writing Drafts**  
    **Context**: Preparing an essay introduction for a school debate on AI ethics.
    
```markdown
Prompt:  
"Draft an engaging introduction for an essay on how artificial intelligence impacts privacy in modern society. Include a rhetorical question to hook the reader."  
```
